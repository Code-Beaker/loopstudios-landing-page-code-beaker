## Process and workflow 📖

Here's a short view of the overall workflow

### Start a project with Vite

Inside the project folder, I initialised a vanilla Vite application

```bash
npm create vite@latest -- --template vanilla app

cd app/

npm install

npm add sass -D

npm run dev
```

After the coding part was done, I compiled the files for production using

```
npm run build
```

### Coding the project

This part took around a week. Coded with Visual Studio Code entirely and tested with **Mozilla Firefox(127)** and **Brave's latest build**. Tested on **Samsung Galaxy A13** for responsiveness.

Used SCSS so that I can make my workflow better and faster with nesting and mixins. I didn't wait for the project to be finished. Instead, I pushed it to github and deployed using Vercel to make sure the live site also works as expected.

### What I learned

I learned to make grid layouts and make them responsive for smaller screen sizes.
I learned to make use of `position: absolute` to build different elements on the site and make them adapt to different screens.
